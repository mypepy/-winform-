In the process of developing a host computer application using WinForm, the login method typically used by customers is card swiping, and manual password entry is not allowed. For this reason, I use a Timer control to set a time interval (one that cannot be achieved through manual input) to periodically disable the timer, clear the text box, and then re-enable the timer.
